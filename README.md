# DiceFootballSimulator

Simulate football matches using **dice-based mechanics** and visualize goals progression and ball possession flows.

Each dice color represents different actions (passes, dribbles, shots, goals), and outcomes are determined randomly. The project records each turn and produces both a **line chart** for goals progression and a **Sankey diagram** for ball possession flow.
